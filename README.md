Discription of the game: We are inspired by the currently popular game "Life Restart", and decide to design a similar but more complex game. It is named "HKU Restart". The                              player will experience the life of a HKU student, and try to complete as many tasks as possible.
Game rules: The aim of this game is to complete as many tasks as possible.

            The total five tasks include 1.Join student organizations 2.Fall in love 3.get a gpa higher than 4 4.enjoy hall life 5.do part time job 6.a flexible task
            The sixth task is a flexible task depending on which faculty the student belongs to. 
            (1.Get a RA job for Science&Engineer students 2.Find an intern for Law students 3.Find a job for Business students 4.Writing papers for Art&Social Science students)
            
            The ability of a student includes 1.learning ability 2.action ability 3.charm 4.social ability 5.money
            Every ability of student has a score (0~10) to represent how strong it is.
            With a stronger certain ability, the player will have higher probability to finish certain tasks at the end of a semester.
            
            Spending some time on some certain things can improve a student's ability. For instance, If a player choose to spend more time on studying, his/her learning ability             will be improved. Every small round (start, midterm , final), the player will has a chance to choose how to distribute his/her time (a player with stronger learning             ability will get more time to distribute) on different things.
            There are totally 5 kinds of things to choose. 1.study 2.go shopping 3.social intercourse 4.take responsibilities and contribute to the student organization. 5.do               research
            
            The game process includes 8 big rounds, and each big round consists of 3 small rounds.
            
            Every big round represents a semester, and the 3 small rounds are "semester start","midterm" and "Final Exam Period" respectively.
